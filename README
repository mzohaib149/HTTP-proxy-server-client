proxy.cc:

we can receive data from either client or server
client sends HTTP request message
server sends HTTP response message

if we receive request message i.e. from client	
	extract server name from request message
	create new socket to connect to server
	create client and server socket mapping
	if cache is empty
		send the HTTP request message to server as it is
		add entry to cache
	if cache is not empty
 		if entry is not found in cache
			send the HTTP request message to server as it is			
			add entry to cache	
		if entry is found in cache
			check if expires header exists
			if it exists and entry is fresh according to it
				check if date accessed is within 24 hours and last modified is within one month
				if it is
					send the HTTP request message to server after adding if-modified-since
				else 
					send the HTTP request message to server

			if it doesn't exist
				check if date accessed is within 24 hours and last modified is within one month
				if it is
					send the HTTP request message to server after adding if-modified-since
				else 
					send the HTTP request message to server


if we receive response message i.e. from server
	find client socket address from mapping
	if we get response with 304				
		send the entry in the cache
	else if we get response with 200
		update cache entry
		in a loop keep on receiving remaining bytes and add to the buffer
		send to client	

client.cc:

check if http:// exists in the name of webpage requested
if it exists remove it
create new GET request and send to proxy
receive response and put it in file
